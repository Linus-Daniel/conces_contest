# Security Testing Scenarios

This document outlines legitimate security testing scenarios for your voting platform to validate the defensive measures against the fraud patterns you discovered.

## Test Categories

### 1. Bot Detection Tests
**Purpose**: Validate your anti-bot protection against automated scripts

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Suspicious User Agents**: Test blocking of python-requests, curl, wget, etc.
- **Missing User Agents**: Verify empty or null user-agent blocking
- **Short User Agents**: Test detection of suspiciously short user-agents
- **Rapid Requests**: Validate rate limiting (>10 requests/minute)

**Expected Results**: All automated requests should be blocked with 403 status and "BOT_DETECTED" code

### 2. Email Validation Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure disposable email services are blocked

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Known Disposable Domains**: Test blocking of guerrillamailblock.com, tempmail.org, etc.
- **Suspicious Patterns**: Validate pattern detection (8 random chars, test123@, etc.)
- **Legitimate Emails**: Ensure real email providers are not blocked

**Expected Results**: Disposable emails blocked, legitimate emails processed

### 3. Phone Number Fraud Detection
**Purpose**: Detect sequential or suspicious phone number patterns

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Sequential Numbers**: Test detection of consecutive phone numbers
- **Pattern Recognition**: Validate detection of number farming patterns
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensure same number can't vote twice

**Expected Results**: Fraudulent patterns detected and blocked

### 4. IP Security Tests
**Purpose**: Validate IP-based access controls

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Whitelist Validation**: Test access from allowed IPs
- **Blacklist Testing**: Verify blocking of unauthorized IPs  
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Test location-based blocking if enabled

**Expected Results**: Only authorized IPs can access voting endpoints

## Controlled Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Automated Security Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
node security-test-framework.js all [project-id]

# Test specific components
node security-test-framework.js bot-detection [project-id]
node security-test-framework.js rate-limiting [project-id]
node security-test-framework.js email-validation [project-id]
```

### Phase 2: Manual Verification
1. Review generated security reports
2. Verify blocked requests in application logs
3. Confirm legitimate traffic is not affected
4. Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Stress Testing
1. Simulate high-volume legitimate traffic
2. Test system behavior under attack conditions
3. Validate rate limiting effectiveness
4. Monitor system performance during tests

## Security Metrics to Monitor

### Detection Rates
- **Bot Detection**: % of automated requests blocked
- **Email Validation**: % of disposable emails rejected
- **Rate Limiting**: % of rapid requests throttled
- **Duplicate Prevention**: % of repeat voting attempts blocked

### System Performance
- **Response Times**: During normal vs. attack conditions
- **Resource Usage**: CPU/Memory under security load
- **False Positives**: Legitimate users incorrectly blocked
- **Logs Quality**: Completeness of security event logging

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Test project ID configured in database
2. Test phone numbers and emails prepared
3. Monitoring tools active (logs, metrics)
4. Backup and rollback procedures ready

### Safety Measures
1. Use dedicated test project IDs
2. Run tests against staging environment first
3. Monitor for impact on legitimate users
4. Have incident response plan ready

## Fraud Pattern Recreation (For Defense Testing)

Based on your fraud investigation report, these patterns were detected:
- **Python requests with guerrillamail**: 2 votes from IP 102.91.102.192
- **Sequential phone numbers**: +2347037001686, +2347037001886
- **Disposable emails**: @guerrillamailblock.com domain

### Defensive Validation Tests
1. **User-Agent Filtering**: Confirm python-requests is blocked
2. **Email Domain Blocking**: Verify guerrillamailblock.com is rejected
3. **IP Monitoring**: Test repeated requests from same IP
4. **Phone Pattern Detection**: Validate sequential number blocking

## Reporting and Documentation

### Test Reports Include
- **Test Coverage**: Which scenarios were executed
- **Pass/Fail Rates**: Security measure effectiveness
- **Performance Impact**: System behavior during tests
- **Recommendations**: Improvements based on findings

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Security Dashboards**: Real-time threat detection
- **Alert Systems**: Immediate notification of attacks
- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term security posture tracking
- **Regular Testing**: Scheduled validation of defenses

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

### Ethical Testing Guidelines
- Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Use realistic but non-malicious test data
- Document all testing activities
- Follow responsible disclosure for any vulnerabilities found

### Data Protection
- Use anonymized test data where possible
- Encrypt sensitive test information
- Secure deletion of test data after validation
- Comply with applicable privacy regulations
